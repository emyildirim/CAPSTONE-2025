## **Communication Guidelines**

### **Primary Communication Tools**
- **Microsoft Teams**: For daily communication, quick updates, and informal discussions.
- **Email**: For formal communication or when detailed documentation is required.
- **GitHub Issues**: For tracking tasks, bugs, and feature requests.

### **Response Time**
- Every Monday 11:30AM to 12:30PM, a mandatory team meeting is scheduled.
- Team members are expected to join the meetings in the first 10 minutes, otherwise let others know about emergencies.
- Team members are expected to respond to messages within **24 hours** during weekdays.
- For urgent matters, use the `@here` or `@channel` tags in Microsoft Teams.
- If work is required on a public holiday, the scheduled meeting will still take place. 

### **Meeting Schedule**
- **Sprint Planning**: At the beginning of each sprint.
- **Sprint Review**: At the end of each sprint.
- **Retrospective**: After the sprint review meeting.

### **Meeting Etiquette**
- Be on time for all meetings.
- Come prepared with updates or questions.
- Respect everyoneâ€™s time and opinions.

---

## **Collaboration Guidelines**

### **Code Collaboration**
- Use **GitHub** for version control and collaboration.
- Follow the **Git Flow** workflow:
  - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
  - Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `bugfix/login-error`).
  - Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** for review before merging into the `main` branch.
- Review PRs within **24 hours** of submission.

### **Code Reviews**
- Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
- Ensure all code meets the teamâ€™s **Definition of Done (DoD)** before merging.

### **Pair Programming**
- Pair programming is encouraged for complex tasks or when onboarding new team members.

## **Coding Standards**

### **General Coding Practices**
- Follow Google's [coding style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/code-samples).
- Keep code readable, maintainable, and well-documented.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write comments where necessary, but avoid redundant comments.

### **JavaScript (.js & .jsx)**
- Use **ES6+** syntax where applicable.
- Indentation: **2 spaces per level**.
- Use **camelCase** for variable and function names.
- Use **PascalCase** for React components.
- Always use **strict equality (`===` and `!==`)**.
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`.

Example:

```javascript
// Bad
var name = "John";

// Good
const name = "John";
```

```jsx
// React Component Example
function WelcomeMessage({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

### **CSS (.css)**
- Follow BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology for naming classes.
- Use **hyphen-separated lowercase** class names.
- Keep styles modular and reusable.
- Avoid using `!important` unless necessary.

Example:

```css
/* Bad */
.buttonPrimary {
  background: blue;
}

/* Good */
.button-primary {
  background: blue;
}
```

## **Conflict Resolution**

### **Open Communication**
- Address conflicts directly and professionally with the involved team members.
- Focus on the issue, not the person.

### **Escalation**
- If a conflict cannot be resolved within the team, escalate it to the instructor or project manager for mediation.

---

## **Documentation and Artifacts**

### **Documentation Standards**
- All documentation should be clear, concise, and written in **Markdown (.md) format**.
- Update documentation regularly to reflect changes in the project.

### **Artifact Storage**
- Store all project-related documents (e.g., `wa.md`, `dod.md`, design files) in the **main branch** of the GitHub repository.

---

## **Definition of Done (DoD)**
Refer to the [Definition of Done Document (dod.md)](dod.md) for the criteria that must be met for a task or user story to be considered complete.

---

## **Amendments**
This working agreement is a living document and can be updated as needed. Any changes must be agreed upon by all team members and documented in this file.
